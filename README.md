## 📌 Technologies Used

- **Oracle SQL** (Varchar2, Number, Date)
- **PL/SQL (basic syntax used)**
- DBMS concepts: relational schema, constraints, relationships

---

## 📁 How to Run

1. Open any Oracle SQL environment (e.g., Oracle Live SQL, SQL Developer).
2. Copy-paste the SQL code from `dbms_project.sql`.
3. Execute each block step by step.
4. View the query outputs to understand results.
